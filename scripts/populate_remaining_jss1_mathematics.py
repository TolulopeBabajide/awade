Script to populate the remaining JSS1 Mathematics curriculum data for the NERDC curriculum.

This script works with existing data:
- Nigeria (country_id = 1)
- NERDC Curriculum (curricula_id = 1)
- JSS1 (grade_level_id = 1)
- Mathematics (subject_id = 1)
- Curriculum Structure (curriculum_structure_id = 1)
- Fractions topic already exists (topic_id = 1)

It will create the remaining 24 topics with their learning objectives and content areas.
