Router module initialization.

This module contains all the API routers for the Awade backend application.
Each router handles a specific domain of functionality (auth, curriculum, users, etc.).

Example usage:
    from .auth import router as auth_router
    from .curriculum import router as curriculum_router
"""

# This file can be used to export routers for authentication endpoints in the future, e.g.:
# from .auth import router as auth_router
