## 3.3 Core Implementation Components

### 3.3.1 Database Schema Design

The database schema was designed to support the complex relationships between curriculum standards, lesson plans, and user contexts:

```python
# Key models from models.py
class LessonPlan(Base):
    """Lesson plans created by educators."""
    lesson_plan_id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    topic_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('topics.topic_id'))
    created_at = Column(DateTime, default=func.now())

class Context(Base):
    """Context information for lesson plans to improve AI generation."""
    context_id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    lesson_plan_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('lesson_plans.lesson_plan_id'))
    context_text = Column(Text, nullable=False)
    context_type = Column(String(50))  # cultural, resources, student_background

class LessonResource(Base):
    """Lesson resources with AI-generated content."""
    lesson_resources_id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    lesson_plan_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('lesson_plans.lesson_plan_id'))
    ai_generated_content = Column(Text, nullable=True)
    user_edited_content = Column(Text, nullable=True)
    export_format = Column(String(10))
    status = Column(String(20), default='draft')
```

### 3.3.2 AI Service Implementation

The AI service (`packages/ai/gpt_service.py`) was one of the most challenging components to implement. The service needed to generate culturally relevant, curriculum-aligned content while handling various edge cases:

```python
class AwadeGPTService:
    def generate_comprehensive_lesson_resource(
        self,
        subject: str,
        grade: str,
        topic: str,
        learning_objectives: List[str],
        duration: int = 45,
        local_context: Optional[str] = None,
        curriculum_framework: str = "Nigerian National Curriculum"
    ) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """
        Generate comprehensive lesson resource with cultural context integration.
        """
        # Construct prompt with local context
        prompt = self._build_contextual_prompt(
            subject, grade, topic, learning_objectives, 
            local_context, curriculum_framework
        )
        
        # Make API call with fallback handling
        try:
            response = self._make_api_call(prompt)
            return self._parse_structured_response(response)
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"AI generation failed: {str(e)}")
            return self._generate_fallback_comprehensive_resource(
                subject, grade, topic, learning_objectives
            )
```

**Key Challenges Solved:**
- **Cultural Context Integration**: The service processes local context to generate culturally relevant examples and activities
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive fallback mechanisms when AI service is unavailable
- **Structured Output**: JSON-formatted responses for consistent parsing
- **Curriculum Alignment**: Integration with curriculum standards and learning objectives

### 3.3.3 Frontend User Experience

The frontend implementation focused on creating an intuitive, responsive interface for educators. The `EditLessonResourcePage.tsx` component demonstrates the complexity of handling AI-generated content:

```typescript
const EditLessonResourcePage: React.FC = () => {
  const [lessonResource, setLessonResource] = useState<LessonResource | null>(null);
  const [isGenerating, setIsGenerating] = useState(false);
  const [isSaving, setIsSaving] = useState(false);

  const generateLessonResource = async () => {
    setIsGenerating(true);
    try {
      const response = await apiService.generateLessonResource(lessonPlanId);
      setLessonResource(response.data);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Generation failed:', error);
      // User-friendly error handling
    } finally {
      setIsGenerating(false);
    }
  };

  const saveLessonResource = async () => {
    setIsSaving(true);
    try {
      await apiService.updateLessonResource(lessonResourceId, {
        user_edited_content: lessonResource?.user_edited_content
      });
      // Success notification
    } catch (error) {
      // Error handling with retry options
    } finally {
      setIsSaving(false);
    }
  };
```

**Key Features Implemented:**
- **Real-time Editing**: Rich text editor for lesson content modification
- **Auto-save Functionality**: Prevents data loss during editing
- **Loading States**: Clear feedback during AI generation and saving
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of network and service failures
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Touch-friendly interface for various devices

### 3.3.4 Export Service Implementation

The PDF export service (`apps/backend/services/pdf_service.py`) was critical for enabling offline classroom use:

```python
class PDFService:
    def generate_lesson_resource_pdf(self, lesson_resource: LessonResource, db: Session) -> bytes:
        """Generate professional PDF document from lesson resource."""
        
        # Get comprehensive lesson data
        lesson_plan = self._get_lesson_plan_data(lesson_resource, db)
        
        # Generate HTML content with professional styling
        html_content = self._generate_html_content(
            lesson_resource=lesson_resource,
            topic=lesson_plan.topic,
            subject=lesson_plan.subject,
            grade_level=lesson_plan.grade_level
        )
        
        # Convert to PDF with WeasyPrint
        html = HTML(string=html_content)
        css = CSS(string=self._get_css_styles())
        return html.write_pdf(stylesheets=[css])
```

**Technical Challenges Overcome:**
- **Professional Formatting**: CSS styling for classroom-ready documents
- **Curriculum Alignment**: Inclusion of learning objectives and standards
- **Content Integration**: Seamless combination of AI-generated and user-edited content
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: PDF generation that works across different environments

## 3.4 Critical Implementation Challenges and Solutions

### 3.4.1 AI Service Reliability

**Challenge**: The AI service needed to handle various failure scenarios while maintaining user experience quality.

**Solution**: Implemented a comprehensive error handling strategy:

```python
def _make_api_call(self, prompt: str, temperature: Optional[float] = None) -> str:
    """Make API call with comprehensive error handling."""
    
    if not self.client:
        logger.info("Using mock response (OpenAI client not available)")
        return self._generate_mock_response(prompt)
    
    try:
        response = self.client.chat.completions.create(
            model=self.model,
            messages=[
                {"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert educational content creator..."},
                {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
            ],
            temperature=temp,
            max_tokens=self.max_tokens
        )
        return response.choices[0].message.content
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"OpenAI API call failed: {str(e)}")
        return self._generate_fallback_response(prompt)
```

### 3.4.2 Cultural Context Integration

**Challenge**: Ensuring AI-generated content reflects local cultural contexts and available resources.

**Solution**: Developed a context processing system that integrates local information:

```python
def _build_contextual_prompt(self, subject: str, grade: str, topic: str, 
                           learning_objectives: List[str], local_context: str) -> str:
    """Build prompt with cultural and local context integration."""
    
    context_enhanced_prompt = f"""
    Create a lesson resource for {subject} (Grade {grade}) on "{topic}".
    
    Learning Objectives: {', '.join(learning_objectives)}
    
    Local Context: {local_context}
    
    Requirements:
    - Use examples from the local context provided
    - Consider available resources mentioned
    - Include culturally relevant activities
    - Ensure practical applicability in the described setting
    """
    return context_enhanced_prompt
```

### 3.4.3 Database Schema Complexity

**Challenge**: Managing complex relationships between curriculum standards, lesson plans, and user contexts.

**Solution**: Designed a normalized schema with clear relationships:

```python
# Curriculum structure linking countries, subjects, and grade levels
class CurriculumStructure(Base):
    curriculum_structure_id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    curricula_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('curricula.curricula_id'))
    grade_level_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('grade_levels.grade_level_id'))
    subject_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('subjects.subject_id'))
    
    # Relationships for easy data access
    curriculum = relationship("Curriculum", back_populates="curriculum_structures")
    grade_level = relationship("GradeLevel", back_populates="curriculum_structures")
    subject = relationship("Subject", back_populates="curriculum_structures")
```

### 3.4.4 Frontend State Management

**Challenge**: Managing complex state for lesson resource editing with AI-generated content.

**Solution**: Implemented React hooks with proper state management:

```typescript
const [lessonResource, setLessonResource] = useState<LessonResource | null>(null);
const [isGenerating, setIsGenerating] = useState(false);
const [parseError, setParseError] = useState<string>('');

// Handle structured content parsing
useEffect(() => {
  if (!content) return;
  
  try {
    const parsed = JSON.parse(content);
    setParsedContent(parsed);
    setParseError('');
  } catch (error) {
    setParseError('Failed to parse structured content');
    setParsedContent(null);
  }
}, [content]);
```
